## Plugin information

This plugin provides a custom format reader to import the contents of a .sas7bdat or .xport data file into your DSS project.

This implementation will work with almost any SAS file but may be slower than the default one provided with DSS. It is provided by the Pandas library shipped with DSS, and may change when future Pandas versions are released.
